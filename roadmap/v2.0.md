# tmgrammar-toolkit v2.0 Roadmap

## Vision

Version 2.0 will focus on solidifying the core developer experience by enhancing the authoring framework, improving the CLI, and adding more robust validation and testing features. This version aims to deliver a complete and polished toolkit for the entire grammar development lifecycle.

## Core Objectives

1.  **Complete the Core Feature Set**: Implement all documented APIs and CLI flags to eliminate inconsistencies.
2.  **Enhance Authoring**: Introduce more powerful authoring features like advanced variables and a fluent grammar builder.
3.  **Improve Developer Experience**: Add more detailed reporting to testing and validation.
4.  **Introduce Performance Tooling**: Provide basic performance and complexity analysis.

## Feature Roadmap

### 1. CLI and Emission Enhancements

*   **Goal**: Fulfill the promise of the original documentation by implementing all documented CLI flags and emission formats.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] Implement the `--plist` flag for the `tmt emit` command.
    *   [ ] Implement the `emitYAML` function.
    *   [ ] Implement the `--yaml` flag for the `tmt emit` command.
    *   [ ] Add rich diagnostics and error reporting to the CLI.

### 2. Advanced Authoring

*   **Goal**: Make grammar authoring more powerful and expressive.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] **Advanced Variable System**: Implement an enhanced variable substitution system that allows for more complex and reusable patterns.
    *   [ ] **Fluent Grammar Builder**: Create a fluent, chainable API for constructing grammars as an alternative to the `createGrammar` factory function.

### 3. Testing and Validation Improvements

*   **Goal**: Provide more insight into grammar quality and test results.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] **Rich Test Reporting**: Add detailed reporting to the testing framework, including summaries and diffs for failed tests.
    *   [ ] **Performance & Complexity Analysis**:
        *   [ ] Add a performance analysis tool to the validation module to identify slow regex patterns.
        *   [ ] Implement a grammar complexity analysis to provide insights into the potential performance impact of the grammar.
    *   [ ] **Security Validation**: Add basic security validation for regex patterns to detect potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.

### 4. Test Runner Integration

*   **Goal**: Allow seamless integration with popular JavaScript test runners.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] Create adapters or plugins for integration with **Jest** and **Vitest**.
    *   [ ] Document best practices for using the toolkit within these testing environments.
