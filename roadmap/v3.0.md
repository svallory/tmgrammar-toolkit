# tmgrammar-toolkit v3.0 Roadmap

## Vision

Version 3.0 will expand the toolkit's capabilities beyond core authoring and testing, focusing on advanced developer tools, ecosystem integration, and features that support large-scale grammar development and maintenance.

## Core Objectives

1.  **Advanced Tooling**: Introduce a development server, scaffolding tools, and debugging utilities.
2.  **Ecosystem Integration**: Connect with the broader TextMate and VS Code ecosystems.
3.  **Large-Scale Grammar Support**: Add features like inheritance and composition for managing complex grammars.
4.  **Enhanced Quality Assurance**: Introduce theme compatibility and test coverage analysis.

## Feature Roadmap

### 1. Advanced Developer Experience & Tooling

*   **Goal**: Provide a world-class development environment for grammar authors.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] **Grammar Scaffolding**: Create a CLI command (`tmt init`) to generate new grammar projects from templates.
    *   [ ] **Development Server**: Implement a development server with hot-reloading to provide instant feedback in a test editor.
    *   [ ] **Grammar Debugging & Profiling**: Add tools to step through tokenization and profile pattern performance visually.
    *   [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Create a dedicated VS Code extension to integrate the toolkit's features directly into the editor.

### 2. Advanced Authoring & Composition

*   **Goal**: Enable the creation and maintenance of large, complex, and interconnected grammars.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] **Grammar Inheritance**: Allow a grammar to inherit from a base grammar, making it easy to create language variants.
    *   [ ] **Grammar Composition**: Support the composition of multiple grammars or mixins.
    *   [ ] **Multi-language Embedding**: Add first-class support for embedding languages, including cross-grammar validation.

### 3. Advanced Quality Assurance

*   **Goal**: Provide deep insights into grammar quality, correctness, and theme compatibility.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] **Test Coverage Analysis**: Implement a tool to analyze which rules in a grammar are covered by tests.
    *   [ ] **Theme Compatibility Checks**: Add a validation step to check how well a grammar's scopes are supported by popular color themes.
    *   [ ] **Accessibility Checks**: Ensure that the chosen scopes and highlighting are accessible.

### 4. Ecosystem Integration

*   **Goal**: Position the toolkit as a central hub in the TextMate ecosystem.
*   **Features**:
    *   [ ] **Grammar Conversion Utilities**: Add CLI commands to convert grammars between JSON, Plist, and our TypeScript format.
    *   [ ] **Grammar Optimization**: Implement a tool to optimize and minify grammars for production use.
    *   [ ] **Grammar Marketplace/Registry Integration**: Add features to publish and share grammars.
